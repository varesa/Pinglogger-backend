Readme for:
Pinglogger commandline utility for monitoring the state and latency of a network-connection


Installation

1st way: Copy the 'pinglogger' folder to where you want the utility to be
         installed. Modify the GlobalConf variable of 
         pinglogger/bin/pingloggerctl to point to the absolute path of the 
         conf/global.conf, and BaseDir in conf/global.conf to point to the
         absolute path to the root of pinglogger-installation (the folder that
         has conf/, log/, pids/ and so on).
            Add <pinglogger_installation>/bin
         to PATH, or make a symlink form <installation>/bin/pingloggerctl to
         location that is in PATH, eg. /usr/bin.

2nd way: Copy binaries and configs to the locations you prefer. Create
         directories that match the remaining directories(log/, pids/).
         Edit your global.conf to have the absolute paths for the other dirs.
         Edit your pingloggerctl's GlobalConf var to point to the conf.

         Note: If you prefer to not have "hardcoded" path in the executable,
         you can set an envrionment variable, depending on the distribution eg.
         in /etc/profile.d/, that points to the conf.

         Examples on paths:
         BinDir       = /usr/bin/
         PidDir       = /var/run/pinglogger/
         "GlobalConf" = /etc/pinglogger.conf
         ConfDir      = /etc/pinglogger.d/
         LogDir       = /var/pinglogs/


Set-up

Set up instances in the directory you pointed configuration-variable $ConfDir
to. You can name these config how you want (Though you propably should use only
following characters: upper- and lowercase ascii characters, dashes and
underscores ).
    The names of these config-files are how you are going to reference the
logging-instances, so you should prefer names that are descriptive and easy 
to type. Set up the configs the way you want.


Usage

Instances of the logger are controlled by a script called pingloggerctl. You 
can use this script to start, stop and see the status of different loggers.
